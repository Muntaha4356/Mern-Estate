#REDUX:
Imagine you run a lemonade stand 🍋.

Store = Your lemonade box that keeps everything: lemons, sugar, cups.

State = What’s inside the box (e.g., 5 lemons, 2 cups of sugar).

Action = A message like “Add more lemons” or “Use 1 cup of sugar”.

Reducer = A machine that reads the message and changes the items inside the box accordingly.



Concept	Simple Meaning	Real Use
configureStore()	Creates your main box (store)	Holds all your state
createSlice()	Creates the message machine (reducer + actions)	Groups logic + state
createAsyncThunk()	Helps with async stuff like API calls	Handles loading/data/errors
useSelector()	Lets you read from the store	Example: const user = useSelector(...)
useDispatch()	Lets you send actions to the store	Example: dispatch(addLemon())

\\multer.js=> server/middleware/upload.js

limit(n)
Restricts the number of documents (listings) returned.

For example, limit(9) returns only 9 listings, even if the database has thousands.

✅ skip(n)
Skips the first n results and starts returning from the (n+1)-th document.

Useful for pages beyond the first.
